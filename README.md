# Anti-Phishing Discord Bot ðŸ¤–

Welcome to the **Sentinel Discord Bot** repository! This powerful bot is designed to keep our SoftUni Discord Community servers safe by monitoring every message for phishing attempts or harmful sites. Our bot uses advanced algorithms to detect and alert you about potential threats, ensuring our community stays protected.


## Features âœ¨

- **Real-time Message Scanning:** The bot scans every message in real-time for phishing links or malicious sites.
- **Role-based Access:** Only users with specific roles can configure the bot settings.
- **Alert System:** Sends alerts to a designated channel or user when a potential threat is detected.
- **Customizable Response:** Choose how the bot responds to detected threats (e.g., delete the message, warn the user, etc.).
- **Whitelist/Blacklist:** Manage lists of allowed and disallowed sites.
